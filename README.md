# Soccer Card Database Project

## Overview
The Soccer Card Database Project is a personal project aimed at showcasing a collection of soccer cards using SQL. This project serves as a practical application of SQL skills, focusing on database creation, data insertion, and data management. The database includes various attributes of soccer cards, such as player names, card types, prices, quantities, and grading information.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For database management and data manipulation.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: (Specify which SQL database you used)
- **GitHub**: For version control and project hosting.

## Features
- **Database Structure**: The database includes the following fields:
  - `Card`: Name of the soccer card
  - `Price`: Price of the card
  - `Quantity`: Number of copies available
  - `Graded`: Indicates if the card is graded (Yes/No)
  - `Get Graded`: Indicates if the card is intended to be graded (Yes/No)

- **Data Insertion**: A set of SQL scripts to populate the database with soccer card information.

- **Data Querying**: SQL queries to retrieve specific data from the database (e.g., finding cards by player, price range, or graded status).

## Getting Started
